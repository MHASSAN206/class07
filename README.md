## JavaScript Functions ?

JavaScript functions are blocks of code that do specific tasks. They take inputs and can give outputs. They make code organized and reusable.
Another way to explain is : Functions are ways that you can create commands that will have steps of code that will repeat whenever you use this command.

> function addTwoNumbers() {

> let num1 = 7;

> Let num2 = 4;

> let sum = num1 + num2;

> console.log(sum);

> return sum;

> }
